<!--l. 516--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10">Warcrabs! </span>grew out of a conversation between the author and one of his
role-playing friends. The gist of the conversation: that the hermit crab &#8211; once
advertised in comic books as the &#8220;Crazy Crab&#8221; &#8211; would make a perfect
RPG character since so much of its appearance and personal identity is
based on the stuff it carries on its back. Of course, all crabs have shells, but
hermit crabs steal shells from others, then move into new shells when they
grow too big &#8211; just like RPG characters moving from one suit of armor to
the next. This conversation grew into the idea of &#8220;battle crabs&#8221; and finally
<span

<!--l. 518--><p class="indent" >   No actual crabs were harmed in the making of this game, and we would like to
keep it that way. <span 
class="cmti-10">Please </span>keep in mind that this game is satirical. It&#8217;s a satire of the
corporate world and of the unintended consequences of genetic engineering. It is not
intended in any way to encourage people to pit crabs in battle against one another, if
this is even possible. This author is a big believer in the pseudo-hippie ethos of the
early gaming community &#8211; where there was an unwritten rule that combat is fun on
paper but fighting sucks in the real world. So <span 
class="cmti-10">please </span>be nice to real hermit
crabs.
<!--l. 520--><p class="indent" >   Let me put it another way. You can buy guns and armored cars and
go autodueling in the desert with consenting adults if you want to. You
can walk around mumbling to yourself about Gorvils and clutching your
Crown Royal bag full of spells if you wish. But please don&#8217;t hurt innocent
animals.
