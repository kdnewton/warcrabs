<!--l. 318--><p class="noindent" >Kang was thrilled. After months of fighting his way to the top of the crab-fighting
rings in Biomedical, Nanotech and IT, he had an experienced crab weighted down
with deadly equipment. And here he was in Public Relations &#8211; where the meanest
bouts went down &#8211; to spend his lunch break fighting for the championship of the
entire wing.
<!--l. 320--><p class="indent" >   There was more than money at stake. Ever since his crab, Crustaceous Clay,
started winning bouts, Kang had been on the rise around the office. Naturally a
wallflower, Kang was becoming a microcelebrity at AssHoTech.
<!--l. 322--><p class="indent" >   Kang watched Gleefully as Clay faced off against the Desk Warrior, a small,
scarred crab equipped with a flamethrower, a pointer and a crappy jetpak. Half the
workers in the PR office crowded around the desk, debating odds and slapping their
money down on the desk.
<!--l. 324--><p class="indent" >   The fight began &#8211; but disaster quickly unfolded. For his opening move, the Desk
Warrior lit up his jets, hoping to close the space between him and Clay. But the
crappy jetpak lived up to its name, misfiring with a crackling explosion. Workers
ducked as the poor crab flew past them screaming, his body now a flaming ball of
sulfur and charcoal. He landed in a wastepaper basket nearby. The basket went up in
a sudden, cinematic gout of flame.
<!--l. 326--><p class="indent" >   Kang rushed up with a fire extinguisher, but he couldn&#8217;t get the little safety pin
out. His heart pounded in his head &#8211; then it sank as the sprinkler system came on,
dousing the entire office.
<!--l. 328--><p class="indent" >   Kang knew it was the end. With the fire, there would surely be an incident
report. He would be fired for crab-fighting. And then what? How would he
keep his visa? How would he find work elsewhere? How could he go home in
shame?

 id="x7-28000"></a>A Secret Culture</h4>
<a 
 id="x7-28000doc"></a>
<!--l. 332--><p class="noindent" >Wargames and role-playing games used to have a certain dissident panache.
Back in the early 1980s &#8211; when the mainstream culture knew RPGs only
through Pat Robertson, Geraldo Rivera and films like Mazes and Monsters &#8211; to
openly admit to gaming was to open yourself to accusations of Satanism and
criminal insanity. Nobody got burned at the stake, but if you were in your
teens at the time, the anti-RPG backlash certainly had a Salem-like feel.
Some people went underground and gamed in secret. Others kept the faith,
running their games in what, retrospectively, seems like a rather brave act of
defiance.
<!--l. 334--><p class="indent" >   Well, that was a long time ago. The dungeoneers of the 1980s are the working
                                                                  

                                                                  
stiffs of the 21st-Century. And in geek-heavy work environments (academia, IT, etc.),
gripes about the D20 system have joined Monday Night Football as a primary topic
of watercooler conversation.
<!--l. 336--><p class="indent" >   <span 
class="cmbx-10">Warcrabs! </span>is an attempt to bring back some of the illicit majesty of the
old wargaming culture. The game is designed to be played on the sly, right
in your office. Like workers at AssHoTech, <span 
class="cmbx-10">Warcrabs! </span>players have the
most fun when the game becomes a secret hobby, a cryptic way of whiling
away a break at work. The rules below explain the basics of AssHoTech&#8217;s
crab-fighting culture and show you how to simulate that culture in your
office.
<!--l. 338--><p class="noindent" >
   <h4 class="likesubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x7-29000"></a>The Rules of Crab-fighting</h4>
<a 
 id="x7-29000doc"></a>
<!--l. 340--><p class="noindent" >At AssHoTech, the crab-fighting rings are governed by just a few rules of honor.
AssHoTech workers may be enlightened Pastafarian science fiction fans with
advanced degrees, but they regard these rules with a deep and almost religious
reverence.
<!--l. 342--><p class="indent" >   The rules:
<!--l. 344--><p class="indent" >
     <ol  class="enumerate1" >
     <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x7-29002x1">Never talk about crab-fighting.
     </li>
     <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x7-29004x2">NEVER TALK ABOUT CRAB-FIGHTING.
     </li>
     <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x7-29006x3">Never spend more money than you&#8217;ve won.
     </li>
     <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x7-29008x4">It&#8217;s all about unintended consequences.</li></ol>
<!--l. 351--><p class="indent" >   Rule #4 is perhaps the one most in need of explanation. When you read the
introduction to this game, you may have asked yourself why prosperous, successful
college graduates would risk their careers to watch a few crustaceans beat the shit
out of each other. Or you may have asked yourself, &#8220;How can I get in on this thing?&#8221;
The world seems to be divided between safe, sensible people and people who like to
take risks and see what happens. Crab-fighters are definitely of the latter category.
They recognize that the risk of career disaster is part of the fun. They accept, with
an almost fatalistic surety, that if they are fired for crab-fighting, it was meant to
be.
<!--l. 353--><p class="indent" >   Indeed, as the people at the Employee Assistance Program keep reminding us,
AssHoTech workers may subconsciously crave a downfall. After all, the world is
rapidly going to hell in a handbasket, but these techies are still able to party like it&#8217;s
1999. Maybe they just can&#8217;t take the cognitive dissonance of being wealthy in a
deteriorating world.
                                                                  

                                                                  
<!--l. 355--><p class="noindent" >
   <h4 class="likesubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x7-30000"></a>Making Money</h4>
<a 
 id="x7-30000doc"></a>
<!--l. 357--><p class="noindent" >At AssHoTech there is a small underground economy surrounding the crab-fighting
rings. The amounts of money in this economy are very small &#8211; but because workers
are honor-bound to spend only the money they win in the game, crab-fighting money
isn&#8217;t like other money. It&#8217;s almost sacred.
<!--l. 359--><p class="indent" >   In AssHoTech&#8217;s crab-fighting matches, prizes are determined by a complex network of
bookkeepers. To avoid all the complexities of bookkeeping, <span 
class="cmbx-10">Warcrabs! </span>has a simple
system for simulating the prize system in crab-fighting.
<!--l. 361--><p class="indent" >   Each battle comes with a prize of <span 
class="tcrm-1000">$</span>0.10<span 
class="tcrm-1000">&#x00D7;</span>1D6 for each opposing crab in the
match (it is possible to have a Grand Melee featuring many crabs and a large
prize).
<!--l. 363--><p class="indent" >   Also, the last crab left standing wins all the money remaining in the account of
the crabs he defeats. (A good incentive to buy all the equipment you can afford
before each combat.)
<!--l. 365--><p class="indent" >   If your crab is killed, you have to start over with a new crab and <span 
class="tcrm-1000">$</span>1.98 in
cash.
<!--l. 367--><p class="noindent" >
   <h4 class="likesubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x7-31000"></a>Experience Points</h4>
<a 
 id="x7-31000doc"></a>
<!--l. 369--><p class="noindent" >For each crab you defeat in combat, you get one Experience Point, which you can
use to increase your crab&#8217;s abilities. Each experience point can be used to
increase your crab&#8217;s Strength, Dexterity or Endurance by one point. Please
note that each of these abilities has a maximum value of 10. If you max
out all your abilities, you can use experience points to increase your base
number of Hit Points, giving you a Hit Point value that exceeds your crab&#8217;s
Strength.
<!--l. 371--><p class="noindent" >
   <h4 class="likesubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x7-32000"></a>Simulating the Witch Hunt</h4>
<a 
 id="x7-32000doc"></a>
<!--l. 373--><p class="noindent" >At AssHoTech, getting caught crab-fighting is a career-ender &#8211; but fortunately,
there are many people who are in on the secret and are willing to cover for
you.
<!--l. 375--><p class="indent" >   That explains why crab-fighters are able to equip their warcrabs with
fireworks and flaming weapons, and use them in combat, without always getting
caught and losing their jobs. Obviously, the sound of firecrackers in a modern
workplace would normally bring SWAT teams and news crews running. But at
AssHoTech, pyrotechnics are accepted as part of the background noise. When
they hear explosions from another office, AssHoTech workers just cough a
lot and say, &#8220;Oh, that noise? It was probably just that copier acting up
again.&#8221;
<!--l. 377--><p class="indent" >   But sometimes things happen that are too big to cover up. There are
mishaps &#8211; uncontrollable fires, injuries to workers and damage to equipment &#8211;
that can only lead to an investigation. And sometimes high-level managers,
                                                                  

                                                                  
perhaps even T. Fred himself, just walk right into an office and catch a ring of
crab-fighters.
<!--l. 379--><p class="indent" >   We thought about making rules to govern mishaps, but this got too complicated
and slowed down game play. So we came up with a simple rule to govern getting
caught. <span 
class="cmbx-10">If you&#8217;re ever forced to explain what you&#8217;re doing to an outsider,</span>
<span 
class="cmbx-10">consider yourself caught &#8211; and fired.</span>

You are free to talk about crab-fighting between battles, and even to recruit
new players to the game. And if you are &#8220;caught&#8221; crab-fighting by another

   <h4 class="likesubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x7-33000"></a>Rogue Crabs and MechaCrabs</h4>
<a 
 id="x7-33000doc"></a>
<!--l. 419--><p class="noindent" >When AssHoTech management banned crab-fighting, they neglected to think about
one important ramification of busting up crab-fights. Crabs don&#8217;t necessarily like
leading lives of gladiatorial combat, so there is always the risk they will run away.
When workers are scrambling to hide an ongoing match, crabs often take the
opportunity to make a run for it. Sometimes workers intentionally let their
crabs go during a bust, so there will be less evidence of wrongdoing. And
finally, fired employees often maliciously release their crabs to get revenge on
the company. As a result, AssHoTech&#8217;s campus is crawling with &#8220;rogue&#8221;
crabs.
<!--l. 421--><p class="indent" >   No one has done a definitive, peer-reviewed study on the intelligence of fighting
crabs. However, according to AssHoTech&#8217;s biotech guys, the average fighting crab&#8217;s
brain-to-body-mass ratio should give it the intelligence of about a seven-year-old kid
&#8211; a cold-blooded, khat-chewing, video-game-addled seven-year-old kid. So it should
not be too surprising that AssHoTech&#8217;s rogue crabs have exterminated every
competing vermin in the building &#8211; rats, mice, roaches and all. They manage to feed
themselves quite well by raiding the cafeteria and even conducting daring, daylight
raids on workers&#8217; bag lunches. They&#8217;ve also managed to keep themselves fairly
well-armed by plundering the office armories of workers in crab-fighting
rings.
                                                                  

                                                                  
<!--l. 423--><p class="indent" >   There is some evidence that the crabs are even building their own fortifications
in the unseen spaces of the AssHoTech campus. The discovery of a large
dirt-dauber-like nest in the sub-basement of Building D caused quite a stir in
the company. No one knows where the crabs got their building material
(contrary to popular opinion, the nest was not made out of Liquid Paper), but
given the weapons caches inside, it was clear that crabs once lived here.
Contractors later found 25 well-cultivated heads of Chia Pot growing in a
little-noticed roof gutter, but it is still not clear whether this was grown by crabs or
humans.
<!--l. 425--><p class="indent" >   After studying the problem and attempting various traditional solutions
(fumigation, traps, fly paper etc.) AssHoTech decided to approach the problem in
true biotech fashion. Rather than wage an asymmetric war against rogue crabs,
AssHoTech engineered and mass produced a tiny robot &#8211; a MechaCrab &#8211; that could
fight and eliminate the crab on its own level. Unfortunately, the company did not tap
into the wisdom of actual crab-fighters in launching the project, and as a result, the
MechaCrab is only a fair-to-middling fighter.
<!--l. 427--><p class="indent" >   Both rogue crabs and MechaCrabs present a danger to crab-fighters. Chance
encounters with either kind of enemy crab will lead to a sudden, unexpected and
potentially deadly combat situation.

<!--l. 432--><p class="noindent" >Once you get a good crab-fighting ring going (say, four to six people) you may want
to appoint a RogueMaster.
<!--l. 434--><p class="indent" >   The RogueMaster&#8217;s job is fairly simple. Whenever someone loses their crab
due to being &#8220;caught&#8221; in a crab-fight, the RogueMaster takes over that
player&#8217;s crab (it might be a good idea to keep a file folder for all the character
sheets you collect). That crab can later return for a surprise attack on any
player.
<!--l. 436--><p class="indent" >   How does a RougeMaster launch a surprise attack? Just fold the rogue crab&#8217;s
character sheet in half (or, if you want to be fancy, fold it into an origami crab) and
write &#8220;ROGUE&#8221; on it in bold letters. Leave it in a common area (say, on top of a
copier). The first player who encounters the crab must fight it, right where it
was found. The RogueMaster gets to control the rogue crab throughout the
combat.
<!--l. 438--><p class="indent" >   If you do not have any rogue crabs (or want to give your players an easy
challenge) you can surprise them with a MechaCrab. The MechaCrab has very simple
characteristics, as listed below:
