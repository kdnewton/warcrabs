<!--l. 47--><p class="noindent" >The future is bright at Associated Holistic Technologies. When the company was
founded in 1997, venture capitalists were making a killing on Internet startups. But it
took an old bricks-and-mortar guy &#8211; legendary Texas oilman T. Fred Hawkins &#8211; to
see the real future of consumer technology. Declaring that &#8220;the next century is a
biotech century,&#8221; Hawkins started AssHoTech with the dream of building it into the
&#8220;Microsoft of genetic engineering.&#8221;
<!--l. 49--><p class="indent" >   Ten years later, AssHoTech has indeed grown into a biotech giant. It&#8217;s the
nation&#8217;s leading producer of baboon stem cells. Its florescent fruit flies are the gold
standard for research. Its work for Homeland Security, though highly classified, is
reputed to be of vital interest to the security of the United States &#8211; and it had better
be, given the size AssHoTech&#8217;s contracts. Small wonder that Business Week labeled
AssHoTech &#8220;the place where the Nineties never ended.&#8221; For AssHoTech workers, it&#8217;s
still possible to become a millionaire before thirty, to land hot chicks by
bragging about your stock options, and to wear a Hawaiian shirt in the
office.
<!--l. 51--><p class="indent" >   It&#8217;s also a mind-numbingly boring place to work. AssHoTech&#8217;s numbers
may cause the business journalists to swoon &#8211; but the company&#8217;s 4,000-acre
Alpharetta campus is a windowless maze of 21st-Century ennui. Biotech,
as it turns out, is all about running the same experiment over and over
again. You may have been celebrated as a wunderkind while getting your Ph.
D., but now you spend your days cleaning Petri dishes and maintaining
equipment like a graduate assistant. You may have masterminded the bold ad
campaign that brought CheapJet back from ruin, but here your job is to keep
it bland and non-controversial while the big checks roll in. You may have
fled here from your birth country in the wheel well of an Airbus, but now
that you have heard &#8220;The Girl From Ipanema&#8221; for the millionth time over
the company speaker system, you are wondering if you should have ever
left.
<!--l. 53--><p class="indent" >   For years, AssHoTech was a primordial soup of overeducated, underemployed
brainpower. So it is perhaps not surprising that new life forms emerged.
As wireless technology and unpaid overtime erased the distinction between
home and work, AssHoTech&#8217;s lab workers and engineers began bringing their
own hobby projects into the lab. First they made Chia Pot &#8211; tiny farms of
dwarf marijuana that anybody could grow on a desktop. Then they made
Z-Monkeys, human-looking brine shrimp with monster-sized libidos. But things
didn&#8217;t really get crazy until an AssHoTech biologist brought in a box of
common hermit crabs &#8211; the kind you find in a pet store &#8211; for a few evil
experiments.
<!--l. 55--><p class="indent" >   Placed in a too-crowded tank, hermit crabs will often fight with one another, but
this fighting is too slow-paced and sporadic to be of any real interest. So our
bored biologist altered the crabs, making them faster, smarter, and more
aggressive.
<!--l. 57--><p class="indent" >   Within weeks, crab-fighting groups had sprung up across the sprawling
AssHoTech campus. Crab-fighting held something for everybody. Biologists went on
                                                                  

                                                                  
tweaking genes to make crabs better and more lethal. Because the crabs would live in
just about any shell-like object, the IT and engineering guys began building
armored, weapon-laden shells for their little warriors. Business and marketing
types became bookies in the complex betting network that grew around the
fights, and public relations officers &#8211; so useless in the real world &#8211; used their
psychological warfare skills and devious natures to become lords of the crab-fighting
arena.
<!--l. 59--><p class="indent" >   Morale was never better at AssHoTech. Productivity was up. The company issued
a flurry of patent requests as its biotech guys, tweaking their hobby projects,
overcame fundamental hurdles and streamlined the gene-splicing process. The
company&#8217;s website and press releases seemed to have an added panache. It was as if,
suddenly, someone was home and the lights were on. One middle manager did an
informal study, and concluded that a worker who wasted an hour of company time
per day on crab-fighting would actually be more productive than the worker who put
in a full eight hours.
<!--l. 61--><p class="indent" >   But it couldn&#8217;t last. For one thing, there was no way for the company to make
crab-fighting semi-official. CEO T. Fred Hawkins was well-known for making chummy
visits to low-level employees, taking them out for beers and listening to their
observations. Early in the emergence of crab-fighting, workers concluded that
high-level administrators would never be allowed in the ring. All of AssHoTech was
soaked in Hawkins&#8217; pushy charisma, and the workers wanted crab-fighting to be a
charisma-free zone.
<!--l. 63--><p class="indent" >   And then there were the legal and public relations ramifications. Animal
activists were already upset about the baboons who were dying in agony on
B wing. The general public was fairly queasy about those human organs
growing in pigs at the AssHoTech Ranch in Cordele. The FDA and EPA were
expressing concern about cross-pollination and the prospect of modified animals
accidentally getting into the food chain. The American public might be
okay with Frankenfood, but they weren&#8217;t going to accept massive genetic
manipulation of an innocent animal when it didn&#8217;t result in some sort of marketable
product.
<!--l. 65--><p class="indent" >   So they banned it. On March 20, 2005, T. Fred Hawkins issued a lengthy
memo now known, in AssHoTech circles, as the Riot Act. Though it never
mentioned crab-fighting by name, or even acknowledged a problem, the memo
laid out harsh penalties for anyone caught &#8220;working on any non-approved
project on company time, or with company equipment&#8221; or &#8220;bringing the
product of any said work into the workplace.&#8221; The penalty for said work was
immediate termination. The memo did not stop crab-fighting, but it did send it
underground.
<!--l. 67--><p class="indent" >   Despite the ban &#8211; or perhaps because of it &#8211; one of AssHoTech&#8217;s worst fears was
realized. Less than a year after the Riot Act was issued, a custodian found a colony &#8211;
indeed, a tiny city &#8211; of wild warcrabs living in the sub-basement of D Wing. Crabs
were on the loose in the building. They were aggressive. And they were very, very
smart....
