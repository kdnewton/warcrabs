<!--l. 137--><p class="noindent" >Combat in <span 
class="cmbx-10">Warcrabs! </span>is organized in turns. One turn in the game represents one
second in real time.
<!--l. 139--><p class="indent" >   In each turn, a crab is allowed to move, and to take one action (usually firing a
weapon or some other attack). The crab with the highest Dexterity gets to move and
shoot first. If two crabs have the same Dexterity, the players roll the dice &#8211; the player
with the highest number gets to move first.

<!--l. 143--><p class="noindent" >If a crab tries to perform a skill that involves one of the three traits, the player
should roll two six-sided dice. If the number rolled is less than or equal to the crab&#8217;s
score in that trait, the crab succeeds in his task. This is called &#8220;rolling against&#8221; a
trait.
<!--l. 145--><p class="indent" >   In combat, crabs must roll against Dexterity to determine whether they can hit
an opponent with a weapon. This is probably the skill crabs will roll against most
often.

Example: </dt><dd 
class="description">Death Boy has a Strength of 6 and a Dexterity of 4. His Opponent,
     the Crustaceanator, has an Endurance of 3. In combat, Death Boy tosses a
     firecracker at the Crustaceanator. He rolls against Dexterity and gets a 5 &#8211;
     meaning that he just missed. However, because the firecracker landed close
     to the Crustaceanator, the Crustaceanator must roll against Endurance
     or else be stunned for one turn. The Crustaceanator rolls an 8, meaning
     that he is stunned. Death Boy runs over to the Crustaceanator and tries
     to lift the crab over his head to fling him off the desktop. Death Boy rolls
     a 4 and the Crustaceanator plunges to his death on the office floor below.</dd></dl>

&#8220;modifiers&#8221; that reflect that difficulty in the game world.
<!--l. 156--><p class="indent" >   The most important kind of modifier is the &#8220;To Hit&#8221; modifier. It gets harder to
hit a target as the target gets farther away. To determine the To Hit modifier for any
shot, just measure the distance between the shooter and the target, then compare to
the table below:

class="description">In the beginning, crabs may not have enough money
     to buy lots of firecrackers, laser pointers and other weapons. They will
     probably engage in Claw-to-Claw combat, using simple weapons like Pickle
     Spears.  There  are  no  range-based  To  Hit  modifiers  for  Claw-to-Claw
     combat. You must be within 1 inch of the target to begin Claw-to-Claw,
     and if you are using a Claw-to-Claw weapon, you just roll against your
     Dexterity to hit.  If you&#8217;re carrying a ranged weapon,  you get the +2
     modifier for being at Point Blank range. (A good reason not to charge an
     opponent who is carrying a ranged weapon.)
     <!--l. 179--><p class="noindent" >You can even attack with your <span

<span

     attack from behind a crab, if it hits, will damage only the crab&#8217;s shell.
                                                                  

                                                                  
     You&#8217;ll have to blast all the way through the crab&#8217;s shell to get to the crab
     itself. For game purposes, &#8220;behind&#8221; the crab is anywhere within the 180<span

     chance of hitting crabmeat. If you fire from the side and hit, roll one die.
     If you roll a 1, 2 or 3, the damage will be applied to your opponent&#8217;s shell.

     complicated, necessitating a lot of tables dealing with blast radius and so
     forth. In <span 
class="cmbx-10">Warcrabs!</span>, there are just three explosive rules.
     <!--l. 193--><p class="noindent" >
         <ol  class="enumerate1" >
         <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x5-7002x1">If you fire or toss an explosive at an opponent and miss your roll by
         <span 
class="cmti-10">only one point</span>, the explosive lands close enough to shell-shock your
         opponent. That opponent must roll against endurance or be stunned
         for an entire turn.
         </li>
         <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x5-7004x2">If you use an explosive in Claw-to-Claw combat (usually a kamikaze
         move by a crab on the verge of death), both crabs in the combat take
         the full damage of the explosion to their crabmeat &#8211; in other words,
         they lose Hit Points, not armor.
         </li>
         <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x5-7006x3">If you are hit by an explosive, you must move your crab <span 
class="cmti-10">one inch</span>
         <span 
class="cmti-10">farther </span>from the opponent who fired that explosive. This simulates
         the blast effect. In other words, if an opponent 10 inches away hits
         you with a Bottle Rocket, you must move your crab so that you are
         now 11 inches away from him.</li></ol>

     subtract the throwing crab&#8217;s weight from his Strength.
     <!--l. 202--><p class="noindent" >A crab takes one point of damage for every foot he falls (falls less than one foot
     do no damage). Also, a crab who falls must roll against Endurance, or

     ground.
     <!--l. 204--><p class="noindent" >Crabs can continue fighting after a crab is thrown or falls off a desk or other
     surface. However, the crab shooting from above has a +1 modifier to hit (in
     addition to other modifiers) and the crab shooting from below has a <span

     modifier to hit.
     <!--l. 206--><p class="noindent" >A crab, standing flat-footed, can jump upward a number of inches equal
