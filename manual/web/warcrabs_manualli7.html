<!--l. 454--><p class="noindent" >In 2005, to protest the Kansas Board of Education&#8217;s decision to introduce
&#8220;intelligent design&#8221; in the classroom, graduate student Bobby Henderson
wrote an open letter to the School Board demanding that they give equal
classroom time to Flying Spaghetti Monsterism. Henderson outlined his
belief of an invisible, supernatural creator called the Spaghetti Monster,
whose existence could be neither proven nor dis-proven, and insisted that the
Monster deserved a place in the curriculum along with the story of &#8220;intelligent
design.&#8221;
<!--l. 456--><p class="indent" >   People didn&#8217;t just get the joke &#8211; they actually laughed. And they started
&#8220;worshiping&#8221; the Spaghetti Monster. Across college campuses, the new religion, often
known as &#8220;Pastafarianism,&#8221; spread like wildfire.
<!--l. 458--><p class="indent" >   The new parody cult had a huge effect on AssHoTech. From 2005 onward,
virtually all of AssHoTech&#8217;s interns and new, under-25, employees have been
self-described Pastafarians, a semi-private joke they find immensely satisfying.
<!--l. 460--><p class="indent" >   For AssHoTech&#8217;s Gen-X workers, however, it&#8217;s a joke they&#8217;ve heard before.
Virtually all of that generation have some affiliation with Ivan Stang&#8217;s Church
of the Subgenius &#8211; which, they will be happy to tell you, is the &#8220;original
joke religion.&#8221; Now that they are older (and have even come to resemble
Subgenius deity Bob Dobbs), the Gen-Xers are unwilling to tolerate a bunch of
whippersnappers who think they&#8217;ve invented religious parody out of whole
cloth.
<!--l. 462--><p class="indent" >   Thus began the Joke Jihad. It started when a Subgenius painted the slogan
(&#8220;Love + Slack&#8221;) on the shell of his warcrab, which then proceeded to torture a new
employee&#8217;s crab to a miserable death in the ring. Later, a Subgenius player&#8217;s crab was
found murdered in a storeroom &#8211; a death that would have been attributed to rogues,
if not for the graffiti found at the site: &#8220;There is no God but pasta, and Captain
Mosey is its prophet.&#8221;
<!--l. 464--><p class="indent" >   Since then, sectarian warfare has become part of the crab-fighting culture. New
players are encouraged to declare themselves either Pastafarian or Subgenius, and
they occasionally engage in gangland-style warfare.
<!--l. 466--><p class="indent" >   If your group decides to play the holy war, each player should declare a religion.
They will then be governed by the following rules:
<!--l. 468--><p class="indent" >
     <ol  class="enumerate1" >
     <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x8-36002x1">Players of the same religion can fight each other in the crab-fighting ring.
     However, in group combat, &#8220;religious&#8221; crabs are required to eliminate all
     crabs from the opposing religion before attacking their own co-religionists.
     </li>
     <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x8-36004x2">The crab-fighting code prohibits one crab-fighter from attacking another
     directly,  outside  the  bounds  of  a  fair  and  formal  crab-fight.  However,
                                                                  

                                                                  
     individual fighters may pool their resources to launch plausibly-deniable
     surprise  attacks  on  their  opponents.  For  <span 
class="tcrm-1000">$</span>2.00  in-game  cash,  a  player
     or group of players may buy a completely new, unnamed crab for use
     in a surprise, kamikaze attack on another crab. Any equipment for the
     kamikaze crab must be purchased at additional expense to the attackers.
     </li>
     <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x8-36006x3">The attackers decide when and where the kamikaze will attack, but the
     RogueMaster controls the kamikaze crab during combat.
     </li>
     <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x8-36008x4">A kamikaze crab will always fight to the death.
     </li>
     <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x8-36010x5">The RogueMaster cannot reveal the identity of the attackers.</li></ol>
