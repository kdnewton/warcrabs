followed by a list of statistics in the following format: (<span

<span

<!--l. 219--><p class="indent" >   If you&#8217;re new to wargaming, please note that damage is annotated in terms like
&#8220;1D6,&#8221; &#8220;2D6&#8221; and so on. This is gamers&#8217; code: 1D6 means that you roll one six-sided
die to determine the weapon&#8217;s damage, 2D6 means you roll two dice and so
forth.
<!--l. 221--><p class="indent" >   Modifiers include any factors, peculiar to the weapon, that affect firing

class="newline" />The standard weapon for Claw-to-Claw combat, the pickle spear is any small
toothpick-like object that can be used by one crab to stab another. Pickle
spears come in two main forms &#8211; a fancy toothpick of the sort used to hold a
hamburger together, and a tiny plastic sword of the sort you sometimes get in a
mixed drink. A crab can create an improvised Pickle Spear in combat, if he
can grab a stray paper-clip. To turn the paper-clip into a weapon, the crab
must spend one turn bending the clip and must successfully roll against
Strength.

class="newline" />A metal version of the pickle spear, charged with electricity. Expensive and heavy,
the vorpal pickle spear adds only +2 to the damage caused by a normal
pickle spear. However, when turned on it is shrouded in a neat, Kirbyesque
field of crackling energy. For some players, that effect alone makes it worth
using.

class="newline" />An old standby in crab-fighting, the pointer is a tiny laser pistol/rifle fashioned from
a key-chain laser pointer. (The transformation from simple pointer to High-Energy
Laser was done by the guys in AssHoTech&#8217;s Defense Contracts Division, so
we are not allowed to explain how this was done.) The pointer is a simple
point-and-shoot weapon, with effectively unlimited charges. It can burn
through paper/wrappers instantaneously: it will burn through any other
cover at a rate of <span 
class="tcrm-1000">¼&#728; </span>per second &#8211; so an opponent hiding behind a picture
frame, slightly less than <span 
class="tcrm-1000">¼&#728; </span>thick, would get one turn of protection from the
pointer.

class="cmti-10">2.00, 2D6, Weight 2, To Hit +2, maximum range 10&#8221;</span>)<br 
class="newline" />Re-engineered from a common fireplace lighter, the flamethrower is a bulky,
hazardous and satisfyingly evil weapon that shoots a stream of fire approximately 10
inches from the shooter. Because it casts a wide swath of flame, the flamethrower
carries a +2 To Hit modifier. However, it only carries enough fuel for 10 shots. If a
crab&#8217;s shell armor is completely destroyed while carrying a flamethrower, he will go
up in a ball of flame the next time he is hit by a ranged weapon and will lose one Hit
Point per turn until he dies.

takes up one Weight point, but after they&#8217;re tossed, the weight penalty is gone. The

pavement? Then you have some sense of what this weapon is about. Somewhat
accurate at the firing distances involved in <span 
class="cmbx-10">Warcrabs!</span>, the Bottle Rocket is usually
fired from a disposable launcher made from a drinking straw. As with firecrackers,
the bottle rocket is discarded after use.

class="cmti-10">2.50, 2D6, Weight 3, special modifiers below</span>)<br 
class="newline" />Inspired by a weapon used in an old Judge Dredd comic, the microwave gun fires a
high-intensity beam that can cook crabmeat in its shell. The microwave gun can fire
right through any cover, and through a crab&#8217;s shell, to do 1D6 damage directly to the
crab&#8217;s Hit Points. However, the microwave beam must be set for a certain
specific range &#8211; say, 10 inches. It takes one turn to set the range to a new
setting, but a crab may move to a position where the current range will
work.

     position and charges at the Crustaceanator, blazing away with his pointer.
     The Crustaceanator weighs his options and decides he cannot lose a turn
     to resetting the microwave beam so he backpedals, once again putting 12
     inches between him and Death Boy. The Crustaceanator fires and roasts
     Death Boy to a crisp.</dd></dl>

class="newline" />The perfect gift for the crab who has everything, a HalfTrack is a set of
tank-like treads that provide a boost to crabs who have too much equipment.
The HalfTrack is heavy, but it does not add to the crab&#8217;s Weight score,
because the shell rests on the HalfTrack. A crab with a HalfTrack has a
Movement score of 2, no matter how much weight it is carrying (up to Maximum
Shell Capacity). A good accessory for a crab whose Weight is at or near
Maximum Shell Capacity. A crab with a HalfTrack cannot jump or use a
jetpak.

class="newline" />(<span 
class="tcti-1000">$</span><span 
class="cmti-10">1.00 per dose, no weight, one-time use</span>)<br 
class="newline" />One of the first off-the-books inventions to emerge at AssHoTech, Chia Pot is a dwarf
variety of marijuana that can be grown, surreptitiously, right in the office. Chia Pot
seeds are generally sold in a grapefruit-sized wad wrapped in pantyhose. Inside the
wad, along with the seeds, is a growing medium and nutrients &#8211; everything
you need to grow Chia Pot. To get your farm started, all you have to do is
soak the ball in water, place the ball on your windowsill, and wait for the
seeds to sprout. To disguise the fact that they are growing an illegal plant,
AssHoTech workers often put their Chia Pot balls in playful containers resembling
                                                                  

                                                                  
cartoon characters, celebrities (Einstein and Don King are popular) or political
figures.
<!--l. 301--><p class="indent" >   Harvesting and preparing Chia Pot for human consumption is a painstaking
process, sort of like threading a needle and searching a kid&#8217;s head for lice at the same
time. THC levels in the plant are low to nonexistent (the plant was engineered from
the non-recreational, research-grade pot that can be legally grown in labs.)
However, when hermit crabs chew the leaves, they often get a mild high.
Think of teenaged Somali gunmen chewing khat leaves, and you get the
idea.
<!--l. 303--><p class="indent" >   A single dose of Chia Pot is expensive, and can be used only once. However,
chewing the drug will give the crab a temporary +1 on Strength, Endurance and
Dexterity and all scores derived from those abilities for the duration of the
match. A crab can be given more than one dose, for a cumulative effect,
but there is a risk of death by overdose. If a crab consumes more than one
dose per turn, the player should roll one die: if the roll is lower than the
number of doses, the crustacean has gone the way of Jimi Hendrix and Jim
Morrison.

class="cmti-10">2.50 Weight 3</span>)<br 
class="newline" />A deadly advantage for the crab-fighter who can afford it, the jetpak contains tiny
rockets that allow a crab to fly rapidly through the air, shell and all. A crab can
move 15 inches per turn with a jetpack, with no need to move around obstructions
(coffee cups, etc.) The crab can jump straight up 15 inches, move laterally 15 inches,
or any combination of movement (10 inches up and five inches forward, for instance).
While moving by jetpak, a crab can shoot with a &#8220;death from above&#8221; advantage (+1
To Hit, <span 
class="tcrm-1000">-</span>1 to be hit by his opponent). If a crab is thrown off a desk or other object,
he can avoid damage from the fall by firing his jetpak. A jetpak can be
used only three times per combat, but can be recharged at no cost between
combats.

class="cmti-10">0.50, Weight 2, disposable</span>)<br 
class="newline" />This is a one-time jetpak fashioned from two Bottle Rockets. Cheap and unreliable,
the system can nevertheless sometimes give that critical boost needed in combat. The
user of a Crappy JetPak can move 15 inches in JetPak fashion, but can
only do so once. The user discards the Crappy JetPak after use &#8211; it&#8217;s held
on with Scotch<sup class="textsuperscript"><span 
class="tcrm-0900">®</span></sup> tape &#8211; and loses the Weight associated with it. Crappy
JetPaks often misfire or tun out to be duds. Each time you use one, roll
one die. If the result is a 1, the jetpak does not fire. If you roll a six, the
jetpak fires but explodes at the end of flight, doing 2D6 damage to the crab&#8217;s
shell.
