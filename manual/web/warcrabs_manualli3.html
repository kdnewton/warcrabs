<!--l. 87--><p class="noindent" >So you&#8217;re a new worker at AssHoTech, and one of your co-workers has surreptitiously
invited you to take part in a crab-fighting ring. At this point, you would head to the
lab to start splicing genes &#8211; or, if you&#8217;re not a biotech guy, you would purchase a crab
from someone who can engineer them.
<!--l. 89--><p class="indent" >   To simulate the crab engineering process, <span 
class="cmbx-10">Warcrabs! </span>uses a point-allocation
system to help you decide which attributes your crab should possess. To start
creating your crab, whip out a copy of the Crab Character sheet.
<!--l. 91--><p class="indent" >   Warcrabs have lots of neat traits (they can be trained to smoke, for instance, and
they enjoy martial arts movies), but for purposes of combat, only three are really
important.

     <dl class="description"><dt class="description">
<span 
class="cmbx-10">Strength &#8211;</span> </dt><dd

     crab acquires an armored, weapon-laden shell, its Strength score will also

<!--l. 101--><p class="indent" >   Each trait is rated on a scale of 1 to 10 (a crab with a Strength 10 is as strong as
he can be, and a crab with a Strength of 1 is very weak).
<!--l. 103--><p class="indent" >   In designing your crab, you have 15 points to distribute among the three traits.
So you could create a crab with a Strength of 5, a Dexterity of 5 and an Endurance
of 5, or you could try a different combination, such as a strong crab (Strength 8) that
isn&#8217;t very dexterous (Dexterity 2).

<span 
class="cmbx-10">Shells &#8211;</span> </dt><dd 
class="description">In  nature,  hermit  crabs  don&#8217;t  grow  shells  of  their  own:  they  live
     in shells that are abandoned by other animals, moving from one shell
     to another as they grow larger. One might say that these animals are
     primitive users of technology.</dd></dl>
<!--l. 109--><p class="indent" >   There&#8217;s nothing primitive about the technology used in <span 
class="cmbx-10">Warcrabs!</span>.
Accomplished fighting crabs are decked out with high-tech, armored shells, featuring
a wide array of weapons systems, all created (or miniaturized) by the techies at
AssHoTech.
                                                                  

                                                                  
<!--l. 111--><p class="indent" >   Each crab starts the game with a simple shell of the sort you might find on the
beach. Even this basic, low-tech shell provides some armor to protect the crab from
attacks from the side, and the rear. The Basic shell provides 10 points of armor,
which means it can absorb 10 points of damage.
<!--l. 113--><p class="indent" >   To find out how much equipment your crab can eventually hold, you need to
determine your Optimum Shell Capacity and your Maximum Shell Capacity.
Optimum Shell Capacity is the amount of weight your crab will be able to hold
without any loss to its speed of movement. Maximum Shell Capacity is absolutely the
largest amount of equipment you can cram into a shell. (A maxed-out crab might
have a lot of equipment but would essentially be a fortress, unable to move: not a
good thing in combat.)
<!--l. 115--><p class="indent" >
     <dl class="description"><dt class="description">
<span 
class="cmbx-10">Optimum Shell Capacity &#8211;</span> </dt><dd 
class="description">The same as its Strength rating.
     </dd><dt class="description">
<span 
class="cmbx-10">Maximum Shell Capacity &#8211;</span> </dt><dd 
class="description">same as its Strength plus its Dexterity.
     </dd><dt class="description">
Example: </dt><dd 
class="description">Death Boy has a strength of 6 and a Dexterity of 4. His Optimum
     Shell Capacity is 6 and his Maximum Shell Capacity is 10.
     </dd><dt class="description">
<span 
class="cmbx-10">Weight &#8211;</span> </dt><dd 
class="description">Weight is a measure of the amount of equipment the crab is carrying
     right  now.  This  number  can  never  exceed  the  crab&#8217;s  Maximum  Shell
     Capacity. Unfortunately, even a Basic shell carries some weight &#8211; so mark
     your weight down as 1.
     </dd><dt class="description">
<span 
class="cmbx-10">Armor &#8211;</span> </dt><dd 
class="description">As mentioned before, the Basic shell carries 10 points of armor, so
     mark your Armor number as 10.
     </dd><dt class="description">
<span 
class="cmbx-10">Hit Points &#8211;</span> </dt><dd 
class="description">The crab&#8217;s Hit Points show how much damage it can take before
     being killed. Your crab&#8217;s Hit Points are the same as its Endurance.
     </dd><dt class="description">
<span 
class="cmbx-10">Movement &#8211;</span> </dt><dd 
class="description">Your movement number is a measure of how many inches your
     crab  can  move  in  a  single  turn.  A  crab&#8217;s  basic  Movement  number  is
     the  same  as  his  Dexterity  number.  However,  when  a  crab  is  carrying
     too much weight, his movement is slowed. If your Weight is higher than
     your Optimum Shell Capacity, determine the difference between the two
     numbers and subtract that number from your Movement.
     </dd><dt class="description">
Example: </dt><dd 
class="description">Death Boy has an Optimum Shell Capacity of 6 and a Dexterity of
     4. When he starts the game, he has only a Basic shell with one point of
     Weight, so his Movement is 4 until he exceeds his Optimum Shell Capacity.
     Later, he acquires 7 Weight points of equipment. Because his shell weighs
     more than his Optimum Shell Capacity he determines the difference (1
     point) and subtracts that from his Movement. His Movement is now at 3,
     and he can move only 3 inches per turn.

<span 
class="cmbx-10">Money &#8211;</span> </dt><dd 
class="description">You&#8217;ll need money to start buying equipment. Folks at AssHoTech
     make a lot of dough, but to keep the fight fair, crab-fighters are allowed
     to spend only the prize money they&#8217;ve won in various crab-fights. By
     long-standing crab-fighting custom, all crab-fighters are expected to begin
     with <span 
class="tcrm-1000">$</span>1.98 in their accounts (an homage to Chuck Barris, perhaps). So
     write <span
