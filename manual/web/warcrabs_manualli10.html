<!--l. 525--><p class="noindent" >T. Fred Hawkins, founder and CEO of Associated Holistic Technologies, has been
called &#8220;the most innovative business thinker of our time&#8221; (<span 
class="cmti-10">Publisher&#8217;s Weekly</span>), &#8220;a
charismatic, shoot from the hip wheeler-dealer&#8221; (<span 
class="cmti-10">Austin Statesman</span>) and &#8220;Teddy
Roosevelt with a Texas accent and big ears&#8221; (<span 
class="cmti-10">Time</span>).
<!--l. 527--><p class="indent" >   Born on a cotton farm in East Texas, Hawkins fast-talked his way into an
entry-level position in locally-owned Grumm Oil, eventually rising to the top of the
company and displacing founding CEO Ed Grumm. He rose to world fame after two
Grumm Oil prospectors were arrested for allegedly acting as &#8220;sex tourists&#8221; in Yemen.
To the chagrin of the Reagan administration, Hawkins hired a mercenary team to go
in, guns blazing, to rescue them.
<!--l. 529--><p class="indent" >   Hawkins used his wealth and newfound fame to launch a third-party bid for the
Presidency in 1984. While he picked up only 2 percent of the vote, Hawkins became
and international sensation &#8211; and killed the Democrats&#8217; chances in the election &#8211;
when he called Walter Mondale a &#8220;pantywaist&#8221; in a nationally televised
debate.
<!--l. 531--><p class="indent" >   When his profits were threatened during the oil glut of the 1980s, Hawkins saw
the writing on the wall. By then Hawkins had controlling interest of Grumm &#8211; and he
sold the company to get into the fledgling business of cloned PCs. Soon he was again
the talk of the nation, when his business/self-help book <span 
class="cmti-10">Four Habits of Bad Ass</span>
<span 
class="cmti-10">Motherfuckers </span>sold 19 million copies. Millions of American workers have since gone
through intense training sessions based on this business classic, leading <span 
class="cmti-10">Newsweek </span>to
declare that &#8220;nobody has contributed more to the cowboy image of the American
businessman than T. Fred Hawkins.&#8221;
<!--l. 533--><p class="indent" >   Hawkins is now leader of AssHoTech, the nation&#8217;s leading provider of technologies
that combine traditional engineering and biotechnology. He prides himself on
having a one-on-one, personal relationship with workers at all levels of the
company.
